# Pulsar
A plugin and mod loader for Space Engineers.<br>
This is a hard fork of the discontinued [PluginLoader](https://github.com/sepluginloader/PluginLoader).<br>

## Installation
Pulsar is portable: simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/SpaceGT/Pulsar/releases/latest) into a folder of choice.<br>
If you are building from source, the deploy script will copy all files to their required location.<br>
An [installer](https://github.com/StarCpt/Pulsar-Installer) exists which can do all the work for you.<br>

## Plugins
Pulsar officially endorses the [PluginHub](https://github.com/StarCpt/PluginHub) for high-quality vetted plugins.<br>
Further sources may be added in-game but make sure you fully understand the risks.<br>

## Contact
We have an active [Discord](https://discord.gg/z8ZczP2YZY) for updates and developer information.<br>
GitHub contributions and bug reports are also welcomed!<br>
